PREREQUISITES FOR BUILDING FW1-LOGGRABBER
=========================================
FW1-LOGGRABBER uses API-functions from Checkpoints'
OPSEC SDK. In order to be able to build applications 
which are using this SDK, a very special build environ-
ment has to be used. Currently building FW1-LOGGRABBER is
supported only for Solaris SPARC platform and the Linux
platform.
* Linux
  - Red Hat 6.2
  - gcc 2.95.1
  - Checkpoint OPSEC SDK NG-FP3 for Linux 2.2
  - for ODBC support iODBC or unixODBC is required
* Solaris SPARC
  - Solaris 8
  - gcc 2.95.2
  - Checkpoint OPSEC SDK NG-FP3 for Solaris SPARC
  - for ODBC support iODBC or unixODBC is required
* Windows
  - Windows NT/2000
  - MS Visual Studio 6.0 SP5
  - Checkpoint OPSEC SDK NG-FP3 for Windows NT/2000


HOW TO BUILD FW1-LOGGRABBER
===========================
a) Set up the Build Environment for Linux

- Install a machine with Red Hat 6.2
- Download Checkpoints Opsec SDK (NG) for Linux
- Untar the Opsec SDK and move the Directory to
  e.g. /opt/CPsdk-NG
- Compile and install gcc 2.95.1 (install-prefix
  e.g. /opt/CPsdk-NG/gcc)
- Untar fw1-loggrabber
- Copy Makefile.linux to Makefile
- Edit the Makefile and change the variables CC, 
  LD and PKG_DIR according to your environment
- uncomment ODBC lines in makefile to enable
  ODBC support.
- modify the ODBC lines according to your 
  environment.
- make

b) Set up the Build Environment for Solaris

- Install a machine with Solaris 8
- Download Checkpoints Opsec SDK (NG) for Solaris gcc
- Untar the Opsec SDK and move the Directory to
  e.g. /opt/CPsdk-NG
- Compile and install gcc 2.95.2 (install-prefix
  e.g. /opt/CPsdk-NG/gcc)
- Untar fw1-loggrabber
- Copy Makefile.solaris to Makefile
- Edit the Makefile and change the variables CC, 
  LD and PKG_DIR according to your environment
- uncomment ODBC lines in makefile to enable
  ODBC support.
- modify the ODBC lines according to your 
  environment.
- make

b) Set up the Build Environment for Windows

- Use a Windows NT or Windows 2000 Workstation
- Download Checkpoints Opsec SDK (NG) for Windows NT/2000
- Unpack the Opsec SDK and move the Directory to
  e.g. C:\Opsec-SDK
- Install Microsoft Visual Studio 6.0 SP5
- Untar fw1-loggrabber
- Use Visual C++ Project File (fw1-loggrabber.dsp)
  for preferences
- build

.SH NAME
fw1-loggrabber \- a command line LEA-client for Checkpoint FW-1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B fw1-loggrabber [--options]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B fw1-loggrabber
is a commandline LEA client is a command-line LEA-client for Checkpoint FW-1. 
Using this tool, it's possible to get FW-1 logging data from remote using
Checkpoints proprietary LEA protocol, which is a part of their OPSEC API. 
The idea for \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR was born due to the need of analysing 
Checkpoint FW-1 log data using LIRE (http://www.logreport.org). Meanwhile
their are a lot of additional features, which hopefully ease daily work
of many firewall administrators.
.SH PREREQUISITES

.SH OPTIONS
In the following lines, all available command line options are described in detail. Most
of the options can also be configured using the configuration file \fBfw1-loggrabber.conf\fR
(see \fB--configfile\fR option to use a different configuration file). The precedence of given
options is as follows: commandline, configuration file, default value. E.g. if you set the 
portnumber to be used to 50000 in the configuration file, this can be overwritten by 
commandline option \fB--port\fR. Only if an option isn't set neither on commandline nor in
the configuration file, the default value will be used.
.TP 
.B -p <portnumber>, --port <portnumber>
The \fB-p\fR respectively the \fB--port\fR option can be used to specify a non-default
port to connect to the FW-1 management station. If this option is used, the configuration
file parameter \fBFW1_PORT\fR will not be used.
.TP
.B -s <servername>, --server <servername>
Using one of these options, the name or ip address of the FW1 management station,
to which \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR should connect to, can be specified on command line.
If this option is used, the configuration file parameter \fBFW1_SERVER\fR will not be used.
.TP 
.B -f <logfilename|pattern|ALL>, --logfile <logfilename|pattern>
With these parameters, the name of the FW-1 logfile to be read, can be specified. This
can be either done exactly or using only a part of the filename. If no exact match can
be found in the list of logfiles returned by the FW-1 management station, all logfiles
which contain the specified string are processed. A special case is the usage of \fBALL\fR
instead of a logfile name or pattern. In that case all logfiles that are available
on the management station, will be processed. If this parameter is omitted, only the default
logfile fw.log will be processed. E.g.
.RS

--logfile 2003-03-27_213652.log
.RE
.RS
--logfile 2003-03
.RE
.RS

The first example display the logfile 2003-03-27_213652.log, the second one processes
all logfiles which contain 2003-03 in their filename.
.RE
.TP
.B -c <configfilename>, --configfile <configfilename>
These options allow to specify a non-default configuration file, in which most
of the commandline options can be configured as well as other options, which are
not available as commandline parameters. If this parameter is omitted, the file 
\fBfw1-loggrabber.conf\fR in the current directory will be used. See below for a
description of all available configuration file options.
.TP
.B --resolve
Using the \fB--resolve\fR option, IP addresses will be resolved to names using 
FW-1 name resolving behaviour. This resolving mechanism will not cause the machine
running \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR to initiate DNS requests, but the name resolution will
be done directly on the FW-1 machine. Enabled name resolution is also the default 
behaviour of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR.
.TP
.B --noresolve
In contrast to \fB--resolve\fR, the option \fB--no-resolve\fR will cause IP addresses
to be displayed in log output instead of names.
.TP
.B --showfiles
The option \fB--showfiles\fR can be used to simply show the available logfiles on
the FW-1 management station. After the names of the logfiles have been displayed,
\fBfw1-loggrabber\fR quits.
.TP
.B --showlogs
The default behaviour of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR is to 
display the content of the logfiles and not just their names. This can be explicitely
specified using the \fB--showlogs\fR option.
.TP
.B --auth    
If you want to use authenticated connections for reading the logfiles, you have to 
use the \fB--auth\fR parameter. In that case you have also configure the FW-1 
management station as well as the FW-1 policy and your local configuration file in order 
to successfully connect to the FW-1 server. Within the configuration file you
can also specify the authentication/encryption algorithm to be used for connecting. 
.TP
.B --no-auth
For unauthenticated connections use the 
\fB--no-auth\fR option, here you only have to configure your FW-1 management station
in order to allow unauthenticated connections. But for security reasons you should 
always use authenticated connections.
.TP
.B --2000
The option \fB--2000\fR has to be used if you want to connect to CP FW-1 4.1 (2000) 
firewalls. You have to consider, that some options are not available for non-NG 
firewalls. These include \fB--auth\fR, \fB--showfiles\fR, \fB--auditlog\fR and 
some other options.
.TP
.B --ng
The default FW-1 version, for which this tool is being developed, is CP FW-1 5.0 (NG), 
which is the default version, is no version is explicitely specified.
.TP
.B --online
Using online mode, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR starts output of logging data at the end of 
the specified logfile (or fw.log if no logfilename has been specified). All future 
log entries will be displayed. If you use \fB--logfile\fR to specify another logfile
to be processed, you have to consider that no data will be shown, if the file isn't
active anymore. This mode is mainly used for continuously processing FW-1 log data 
and continues to display log entries also after scheduled and manual log switches.
.TP
.B --no-online
In contrast to online mode, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR quits after having displayed the last
log entry, when running in offline mode. This is the default behaviour and is mainly
used for analysis of historic log data.
.TP
.B --auditlog
Using the audit mode, content of the audit logfile (fw.adtlog) can be displayed. This 
includes administrator actions and uses different fields than normal log data.
.TP
.B --normallog
The default mode of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR processes normal FW-1 logfiles. In contrast 
to the \fB--auditlog\fR option, no admistration actions are displayed in this mode, but
all regular log data.
.TP
.B --filter \*(lq<filterexpression1>[;<filterexpression2>]\*(rq
Using one or multiple \fB--filter\fR options, you are able to filter log entries in 
order to see only entries which match your filter rules. You can specify multiple 
filter rules using multiple \fB--filter\fR options. All filter rules are related by
OR, i.e. if you specify multiple rules, a log entry will be displayed if one of the
rules matches. Within one filter rule, you can specify multiple arguments. All of these
arguments are related by AND, i.e. a single filter rule only matches a given log entry
if the log entry is matched by all arguments. A more detailed description of filter rules
you can find below in a separate chapter about filtering which also provides various examples.
.TP
.B --fields \*(lq<field1>[;<field2>]\*(rq
The \fB--fields\fR option can be used to display only a given set of fields
instead of displaying all available fields. The order of the fields is 
always the same despite the order of the fields specified with the \fB--fields\fR
option. E.g.
.RS

--fields "loc;src;dst"
.RE
.RS

You can display the currently supported fields with the \fB--help-fields\fR option.
If you are missing some fields, please run \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR with \fB--debug-level 1\fR 
and check for debug output containing \fI"Unsupported field found: fieldname=fieldvalue"\fR.
If you send me these lines I will implement the missing fields in the next release.
.RE
.TP
.B --fieldnames
Using the \fB--fieldnames\fR option the name of each field will be prepended to
each value in each line of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR output. E.g.  
.RS
 
loc=42|src=1.2.3.4|dst=4.3.2.1 
.RE
.TP
.B --nofieldnames
In contrast to the \fB--fieldnames\fR option, the usage of this option will cause
fieldnames to be displayed in the first line of output only. All the following output
lines contain only the fieldvalues separated by '|' or by a user defined separator. E.g.
.RS

loc|src|dst
.RE
.RS
42|1.2.3.4|4.3.2.1
.RE
.TP
.B --mysql 
EXPERIMENTAL! This option enables mysql-mode for storing log data in a MySQL database.
In order to support more databases and my unwillingness to deal with MS-SQL or Oracle
APIs, this feature will be replaced in on of the following versions by a Perl wrapper 
script, which supports multiple database systems.
.TP
.B --no-mysql
This option just disables the mysql-mode and forces \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR to use the 
default output method for log data.
.TP
.B --debuglevel <0-3>
Sets the debuglevel to the specified value. A debuglevel of 0 means no output of
debug informations. Further debuglevels will cause output of program specific as well
as OPSEC specific debug informations.
.TP
.B --help
Use \fB--help\fR to display basic help and usage information. For further help, please
refer to the man page.
.TP
.B --help-fields
This option just displays all fieldnames which are currently supported by 
\fBfw1-loggrabber\fR for both normal logfiles and audit logfiles.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
This paragraph deals with the options that can be set within the configuration file.
The default configuration file is \fBfw1-loggrabber.conf\fR which should be in the 
current directory. (see \fB--configfile\fR option to use a different configuration file). 
The precedence of given
options is as follows: commandline, configuration file, default value. E.g. if you set the 
portnumber to be used to 50000 in the configuration file, this can be overwritten by 
commandline option \fB--port\fR. Only if an option isn't set neither on commandline nor in
the configuration file, the default value will be used.
.TP
.B DEBUG_LEVEL=<0-3>
Sets the debuglevel to the specified value. A debuglevel of 0 means no output of
debug informations. Further debuglevels will cause output of program specific as well
as OPSEC specific debug informations. This parameter can be overwritten by 
\fB--debug-level\fR command-line option.
.TP
.B MYSQL_MODE={yes|YES|no|NO}
EXPERIMENTAL! This option enables or disables mysql-mode for storing log data in a MySQL database.
In order to support more databases and my unwillingness to deal with MS-SQL or Oracle
APIs, this feature will be replaced in on of the following versions by a Perl wrapper 
script, which supports multiple database systems. The correspondent command-line parameters
are \fB--mysql\fR and \fB--no-mysql\fR.
.TP
.B MYSQL_HOST=<Hostname of MySQL-Server>
EXPERIMENTAL! If mysql-mode is used, the name or the ip address of the MySQL-server
has to be specified using this option.
.TP
.B MYSQL_USER=<Username for MySQL-Database>
EXPERIMENTAL! If mysql-mode is used, the username for the MySQL-database
has to be specified using this option.
.TP
.B MYSQL_PASSWORD=<Password for MySQL-Database>
EXPERIMENTAL! If mysql-mode is used, the password for the MySQL-database
has to be specified using this option.
.TP
.B MYSQL_DATABASE=<Database-Name of MySQL-Database>
EXPERIMENTAL! If mysql-mode is used, the name of the MySQL-database
has to be specified using this option.
.TP
.B FW1_SERVER=<IP address of FW1-Management Station>
With this option, the name or ip address of the FW1 management station,
to which \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR should connect to, can be specified.
The correspondent command-line parameter is \fB--server\fR.
.TP
.B FW1_PORT=<Port number for LEA connections>
This option can be used to specify a non-default
port to connect to the FW-1 management station.
The correspondent command-line parameter is \fB--port\fR.
.TP
.B FW1_LOGFILE=<Name of FW1-Logfilename>
With this parameter, the name of the FW-1 logfile to be read, can be specified. This
can be either done exactly or using only a part of the filename. If no exact match can
be found in the list of logfiles returned by the FW-1 management station, all logfiles
which contain the specified string are processed. If this parameter is omitted, the default
logfile fw.log will be processed.
The correspondent command-line parameter is \fB--logfile\fR.
.TP
.B FW1_OUTPUT=<files|logs>
This parameter simply specifies whether \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR should only display the 
available logfiles (files) on the FW-1 server or display the content of the logfiles (logs).
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--showfiles\fR and \fB--showlogs\fR.
.TP
.B FW1_TYPE=<NG|ng|2000>
Using this parameter you can choose to which version of FW-1 to connect to. For Checkpoint
FW-1 5.0 (NG) you have to specify NG and for Checkpoint FW-1 4.1 (2000) you have to specify 2000.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--2000\fR and \fB--ng\fR.
.TP
.B FW1_MODE=<audit|AUDIT|normal|NORMAL>
This parameter enables you to specify whether to display audit logs which contain 
administrative actions of normal security logs, which contain data about dropped and 
accepted connections.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--auditlog\fR and \fB--normallog\fR.
.TP
.B ONLINE_MODE=<yes|YES|no|NO>
Using online mode, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR starts output of logging data at the end of 
the specified logfile (or fw.log if no logfilename has been specified). All future 
log entries will be displayed. If you use \fB--logfile\fR to specify another logfile
to be processed, you have to consider that no data will be shown, if the file isn't
active anymore. This mode is mainly used for continuously processing FW-1 log data.
If you disable online mode, \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR quits after having displayed the last
log entry. This is the default behaviour and is mainly
used for analysis of historic log data.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--online\fR and \fB--no-online\fR.
.TP
.B RESOLVE_MODE=<yes|YES|no|NO>
With this option, IP addresses will be resolved to names using 
FW-1 name resolving behaviour. This resolving mechanism will not cause the machine
running \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR to initiate DNS requests, but the name resolution will
be done directly on the FW-1 machine. Enabled name resolution is also the default 
behaviour of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR.
If you disable resolving mode this will cause IP addresses
to be displayed in log output instead of names.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--resolve\fR and \fB--no-resolve\fR.
.TP
.B SHOW_FIELDNAMES=<yes|YES|no|NO>
Using this option can be chosen, whether the name of each field should be displayed i
in each line of log output (YES) of just in the first line of output.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--fieldnames\fR and \fB--nofieldnames\fR.
.TP
.B RECORD_SEPARATOR=<char>
This parameter can be used to change the default record separator (|) into another character.
If you choose a character which is contained in some log data, the occurrence within the 
logdata will be escaped by a backslash.
.TP
.B DATEFORMAT=<CP|UNIX|STD>
Using the \fBDATEFORMAT\fR option, you can choose between three different date formats 
for output of date fields. The value \fBCP\fR provides the standard Checkpoing date
format ( 3Feb2004 14:15:16). Using the values \fBUNIX\fR or \fBSTD\fR you can change 
this into standard Unix time format (1051655431) or into a standardized human-readable
format (2004-02-03 14:15:16).
.TP
.B LOGGING_CONFIGURATION=<screen|file|syslog>
The \fBLOGGING_CONFIGURATION\fR parameter can be used for redirection of logging output to
other destinations than the default destination STDOUT, i.e. screen. Currently it's possible
to redirect output to a file or to syslog daemon (Unix only). Using the parametes 
\fBOUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX\fR and \fBOUTPUT_FILE_ROTATESIZE\fR, you can specify more details,
if you choose to redirect the output to a file.
.TP
.B OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX=<prefix of output file>
This parameter can be used to define a prefix for the output filename. Eventually the output 
file will get the suffix \fB.log\fR respectively a datestamp when it gets rotated. The
default value for this prefix is simply \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR. This parameter will only be 
used if \fBLOGGING_CONFIGURATION\fR is set to \fBfile\fR.
.TP
.B OUTPUT_FILE_ROTATESIZE=<rotatesize in bytes>
Using this parameter you can specify the maximum size of the output files, before they will
be rotated. If the size of the output file exceeds the given value, the logfile will be rotated
to <OUTPUT_FILE_PREFIX>-YYYY-MM-DD-hhmmss[-x].log. The default value is 1048576 bytes, 
which equals 1 megabyte. It should be obvious
that this parameter will only be used if \fBLOGGING_CONFIGURATION\fR is set to \fBfile\fR.
.TP
.B AUTHENTICATED={yes|YES|no|NO}
If you want to use authenticated connections for reading the logfiles, you have to 
use set parameter to YES. In that case you have also configure the FW-1 
management station as well as the FW-1 policy and your local configuration file in order 
to successfully connect to the FW-1 server. Within the configuration file you
can also specify the authentication/encryption algorithm to be used for connecting.
For security reasons it's generally recommended to use authenticated connections to
connect \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR to FW-1 servers.
The correspondent command-line parameters are \fB--auth\fR and \fB--no-auth\fR.
.TP
.B AUTHENTICATION_TYPE=<authtype value>
For authenticated connections to FW-1 servers one of the following authentication 
method can be used: SSLCA, SSLCA_COMP, SSLCA_RC4, SSLCA_RC4_COMP, ASYM_SSLCA, ASYM_SSLCA_COMP, 
ASYM_SSLCA_RC4, ASYM_SSLCA_RC4_COMP or SSLCA_CLEAR. You have to consider that your FW-1 server
must also be configured in order to be able to use the chosen authentication method.
.TP
.B OPSEC_CERTIFICATE=<Path and Name of Opsec Certificate>
Use this option to specify path and name of the PKCS#12 certificate which you pull
from your FW-1 management server when initializing Secure Internal Communication (SIC).
.TP
.B OPSEC_CLIENT_DN=<DN of Opsec-Client>
This option has to be used to specify the distinguished name of the client object for 
\fBfw1-loggrabber\fR, which has to be defined in your FW-1 policy prior to be able
to use authenticated connections.
.TP
.B OPSEC_SERVER_DN=<DN of Opsec-Server>
Here you can specify the distinguished name of your FW-1 server, to which \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR
connects to. You can find this distinguished name in the properties of the server object
in your FW-1 policy.
.SH CONFIGURE FW-1
For both authenticated and unauthenticated connections of \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR to  
FW-1 servers there is the need for additional configuration on both the FW-1 side and
the \fBfw1-loggrabber\fR side. This section describes the necessary steps to successfully

.SH FILTERING
Filter rules provide the possibility to display only log entries that
match a given set of rules. There can be specified one or more filter 
rules using one or multiple \fB--filter\fR arguments on the command 
line. All individual filter rules are related by OR. That means a log
entry will be displayed if at least one of the filter rules matches.
Within one filter rule, there can be specified multiple arguments. All 
these arguments are related by AND. That means a filter rule matches a
given log entry only, if all of the filter arguments match.
